1. In the hint above, describe the values that are the result of data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept? How is this calculated? 

In order to let it fir into one line.  It has to form the formula y = mx + b;
b is the fir intercept m is the slop and data['timestamp'] is the value on the x.


2.In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph? Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make points on the plot? 

because the slop and intercept has been calculated.  If the slop and intercept is fixed.  All the points calculated should be on one line.
