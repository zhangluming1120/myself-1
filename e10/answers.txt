According to my answer of under subsection(2)(3)(4) under question1, most of the time was spend on user.  User is the amount of CPU time spent in user-mode code (outside the kernel) within the process. This is only actual CPU time used in executing the process.  It means that calculating the averages took the most time rather than reading the files.

I used cache right before the groupby, becasue it is used after the join
